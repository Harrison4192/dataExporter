## argument descriptions

## df: the data frame to export

When using make excel, the first input is a dataframe, but do not input an expression or use a pipe. A variable name is necessary for proper naming of the excel output, which is sent to the working directory and named after the data frame. 

### last id col

The recommended ouput format is to put ID style columns first and and value columns after. Last_id_col takes the integer index of the last id column.

### header words

If value columns are organized by header words they can be included in a character string. This will color code the column headers. Split and merge cells are not used to mantain ease of read / write compatability of the workbook with R. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
make_excel(df = iris, 
           header_word = c("Sepal", "Petal"),
           last_id_col = NULL,  
           widths = 13)

```
