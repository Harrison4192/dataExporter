# automatic formatting

Output is automatically formatted depending on the mode of the columns

# argument descriptions

## df

When using make excel, the first input is a dataframe, but do not input an expression or use a pipe. A variable name is necessary for proper naming of the excel output, which is sent to the working directory and named after the data frame. 

## last id col

The recommended ouput format is to put ID style columns first and and value columns after. Last_id_col takes the integer index of the last id column.

## header words

If value columns are organized by header words they can be included in a character string. This will color code the column headers. Split and merge cells are not used to mantain ease of read / write compatability of the workbook with R. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
make_excel(df = iris, 
           header_word = c("Sepal", "Petal"),
           last_id_col = NULL)

```

## make simple excel

`make_simple_excel` allows the user to export to excel but with minimal formatting. THe data frame can be piped in, and unless specfied otherwise in `output_file, the resulting excel file will be named after the data frame. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
iris %>% 
  make_simple_excel()
```

## make an excel workbook with multiple sheets

```{r}
make_excel_wb(wb = NULL,
              object = iris,
              last_id_col = NULL,
              header_word = c("Sepal", "Petal")) %>% 
  make_excel_wb(object = anscombe,
                last_id_col = NULL,
                header_word = NULL) %>% 
  finish_excel_wb(wb_name = "data_workbook")
```
